## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "DAO Not Loading" Issues
**Symptoms**: DAO dashboard shows loading indefinitely or displays errors
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Authentication Status**:
   - Verify Internet Identity connection is active
   - Try logging out and logging back in
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

2. **Verify DAO Deployment**:
   - Check if DAO launch completed successfully
   - Look for confirmation message or email
   - Try accessing DAO directly via URL: `/dao/{daoId}/manage`

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Use supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Disable ad blockers and privacy extensions temporarily
   - Enable JavaScript and allow third-party cookies

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Check internet connection stability
   - Try switching to a different network
   - Clear DNS cache or try different DNS servers

#### "Canister Communication Errors"
**Symptoms**: Error messages mentioning "canister not found" or "call failed"
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Canister Status**:
   - Verify all backend canisters are deployed
   - Check canister cycle balance (may need topping up)
   - Confirm canister IDs in environment variables

2. **Authentication Problems**:
   - Ensure Internet Identity session is valid
   - Principal must be registered with the DAO
   - Try reconnecting Internet Identity

3. **Development Environment Issues**:
   - Restart local IC replica: `dfx stop && dfx start --clean`
   - Redeploy canisters: `./deploy.sh`
   - Check dfx version compatibility

#### "Proposal Creation Failed"
**Symptoms**: Unable to create new proposals, form submission fails
**Solutions**:
1. **Permission Verification**:
   - Ensure account has proposal creation rights
   - Check if minimum token threshold is met
   - Verify account is not suspended or restricted

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Check all required fields are filled correctly
   - Verify proposal title length (max 100 characters)
   - Ensure description is within limits (max 5000 characters)

   - Ensure staking module is enabled for the DAO

2. **Lock Period Issues**:
   - Cannot unstake before lock period expires
   - Check remaining lock time in dashboard

   - Rewards update periodically (may take up to 1 hour)
   - Check if reward distribution is active
   - Verify staking pool has sufficient reward tokens

#### "Treasury Access Denied"
**Symptoms**: Cannot view treasury balance, transactions fail
**Solutions**:
1. **Permission Levels**:
   - Treasury access requires admin or treasurer role
   - Multi-sig operations need multiple approvals
   - Check role assignments in DAO settings

2. **Multi-Signature Requirements**:
   - Large transactions require multiple signatures
   - Check pending approvals from other signatories
   - Verify signatory wallets are properly configured

#### "Module Not Available"
**Symptoms**: Expected DAO modules not visible or functional
**Solutions**:
1. **Module Configuration**:
   - Verify modules were enabled during DAO creation
   - Check module deployment status
   - Some modules may require additional setup

2. **Feature Availability**:
   - Not all features available in all module configurations
