rxshil09: give me a complete overview of the dao_backend. also check all the files and tell me how much completed they are. check the time function as well because it is giving wrong date when i check in the backend candid ui.  give me a percent completion table for the backend

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationI'll provide a comprehensive overview of the dao_backend by analyzing all the files in the attached folder.

## DAO Backend Overview

The DAO backend is structured as a modular canister system with a main coordinator and specialized modules for different functionalities.

### Architecture Analysis

**Main Coordinator (`main.mo`)**
- Acts as the central hub for the entire DAO system
- Manages user profiles, admin permissions, and canister references
- Provides initialization and configuration management
- Handles cross-canister communication coordination

**Specialized Modules:**
- **Governance** (`governance/main.mo`) - Proposal and voting system
- **Staking** (`staking/main.mo`) - Token staking and rewards
- **Treasury** (`treasury/main.mo`) - Fund management
- **Proposals** (`proposals/main.mo`) - Proposal lifecycle
- **Assets** (`assets/main.mo`) - Asset management
- **Shared Types** (`shared/types.mo`) - Common data structures

## Completion Status Analysis

| Module | Completion % | Status | Key Issues |
|--------|--------------|--------|------------|
| **Main DAO Backend** | 85% | ðŸŸ¢ Mostly Complete | Time function returns nanoseconds instead of milliseconds |
| **Shared Types** | 95% | ðŸŸ¢ Complete | Well-defined type system |
| **Governance** | 70% | ðŸŸ¡ Functional | Missing execution logic, basic voting only |
| **Staking** | 80% | ðŸŸ¢ Mostly Complete | Core staking works, APR calculation needs refinement |
| **Treasury** | 60% | ðŸŸ¡ Basic | Missing multi-sig, limited transaction types |
| **Proposals** | 50% | ðŸ”´ Basic Framework | Missing proposal execution and complex types |
| **Assets** | 40% | ðŸ”´ Basic Framework | Minimal implementation, needs significant work |

- âœ… Basic asset structure
- âœ… Simple asset storage

**Missing:**
- ðŸ”´ Comprehensive asset management
- ðŸ”´ Asset transfer mechanisms
- ðŸ”´ Integration with treasury
- ðŸ”´ Asset valuation and tracking

## Time Function Issue Analysis

The time function issue you mentioned is in the main DAO backend. The problem is that Internet Computer's `Time.now()` returns nanoseconds since epoch, but your frontend likely expects milliseconds.

**Current Code:**
```motoko
Time.now() // Returns nanoseconds
```

**Fix Needed:**
```motoko
Time.now() / 1_000_000 // Convert to milliseconds
```

This should be updated in:
- User registration timestamps
- Proposal creation times
- Activity timestamps
- Any other time-related operations

## Recommendations for Completion

### Priority 1 (Critical):
1. **Fix time function** - Convert nanoseconds to milliseconds
2. **Complete governance execution** - Link voting results to actions
3. **Implement multi-sig treasury** - Essential for security

### Priority 2 (Important):
1. **Enhance staking rewards** - More sophisticated calculation
2. **Complete proposal system** - Full lifecycle management
3. **Integrate cross-canister calls** - Connect all modules

### Priority 3 (Nice to have):
1. **Expand asset management** - Full featured asset handling
2. **Advanced governance** - Quadratic voting, delegation
3. **Analytics and reporting** - Comprehensive DAO metrics

The backend has a solid foundation with about 65% overall completion. The core functionality is there, but several modules need significant work to be production-ready.
