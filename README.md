# `dao2`

Welcome to your our `dao launcher kit` project and to the Internet Computer development community. 

To learn more before you start working with `dao2`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)
- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)
- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd dao2/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

# Module Registry Canister for DAO Governance
The Module Registry Canister is a core component in modular DAO architecture, responsible for managing and governing DAO modules (such as voting, treasury, staking, or analytics). It serves as a decentralized registry where modules can be registered, upgraded, deprecated, or replaced through transparent governance proposals.

🛠 Key Functions
- Module Registration: Add new modules with metadata (name, type, version, canister ID).

- Governance Hooks: Allow DAO members to propose changes to modules and vote on upgrades.

- Version Control: Track module versions and support safe upgrades and rollbacks.

- Access Control: Ensure only authorized entities or DAO decisions can modify the registry.

This canister ensures plug-and-play flexibility, allowing a DAO to evolve its functionality without compromising core integrity. It lays the foundation for a sustainable, upgradable, and community-driven governance framework.

## 🌐 What is IPFS?

[IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)](https://ipfs.tech/) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer file storage protocol designed to make the web more distributed and resilient. Instead of relying on centralized servers, IPFS stores files across a global network of nodes.

### 🔧 Key Benefits

- **Content Addressing**: Files are accessed via their cryptographic hash, ensuring immutability and integrity.
- **Decentralization**: Eliminates single points of failure by distributing data.
- **Efficient Delivery**: Supports deduplication and caching, improving performance and reducing bandwidth.
- **Permanent Storage**: Ideal for storing static assets, metadata, and off-chain content in blockchain or DAO ecosystems.

### 📦 Use Case in DAO

In the context of a DAO, IPFS can be used to store module metadata, proposal documents, or governance records off-chain, while referencing them on-chain via their hash.
